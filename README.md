# Keratin-Degradation
Keratinase enzyme could be used as a potential source for the biodegradation of wastes which contains Keratin such as feather wastes from poultry farms, hair wastes from saloons, Other farm wastes etc. 

In this project we first searched for a potential source where we might find the microorganisms which has the capability of producing Keratinase - an enzyme capable of degrading Keratin. The potential sources in which we selected was feather waste dumping sites. The sample was prepared and enriched for Keratinase production. We selected microorganisms which showed the best Keratinase Degrading Index.These Microorganisms where further sub cultured and subjected to identification by cultural, biochemical, molecular characterization
